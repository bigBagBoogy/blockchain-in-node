# your workflow should be:

Run `npm run dev` to start TypeScript in watch mode and compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript.

Once the TypeScript compiler is running, you can open a new terminal or command prompt.

In the new terminal, run `npm start` to start your Node.js application using the compiled JavaScript code.

This should execute your blockchain code as intended.
